# FunctionGenerator
Function Generator with frequency and amplitude regulation using ring oscillator

In 1.png you can see the fenerated functions, in 2.png you can see sin wave with diffrent frequency and in 3.png you can see sin with different amplitudes.
This project contains three main modules named amplitudeSelector.v, frequencyRegulator.v, functionGenerator.v and RingOscillator.v which creates a simple clock.
There are also two testbenches available.
